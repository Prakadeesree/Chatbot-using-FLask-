# Chatbot-using-FLask-
This project is a simple AI-powered chatbot built using Flask (Python web framework) and ChatterBot (a conversational AI library). The chatbot reads a training file (chatbot.txt), trains itself using predefined conversations, and responds to user queries through a clean web interface.
